# Neural-Style-Transfer
This is an implementation of Neural Style Transfer using pretrained VGG19 model (can be found at http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/models/imagenet-vgg-verydeep-19.mat)

The algorithm used for style transfer is based on Andrew Ng's Deep Learning Specialization course on Coursera.
